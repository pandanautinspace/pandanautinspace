### Good Morning!

My name is Kenneth Browder. I'm currently a Master's student at [IP Paris](https://ip-paris.fr), studying Computer Graphics and AI under the Interaction, Graphics, and Design Masters program.  

I'm passionate about finding new uses for technology in creative fields. Thus, I'm always interested in talking to current and aspiring creatives, scientists, and engineers. If you're interested in having a chat, message me on linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenneth-browder/). 

Thanks for visiting my profile, and I hope you have a great day. Goodbye!
